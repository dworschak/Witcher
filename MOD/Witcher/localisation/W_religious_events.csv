EVTDESCreligious.10;I sit in the local Church during the Bishop’s sermon, tired and weary. Why is the world such a cruel, terrible place? The voice of the preaching Bishop fades away, as I begin to focus elsewhere. I begin to pray to God, to pray for forgiveness of my sins, to pray that I may enjoy life once more.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAreligious.10;Father in the heavens above...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAMEreligious.31;A Visitor;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCreligious.31;You have received a visitor, a priestess from the famous Temple of Melitele. She tells you that the priestesses there spend days in devoted prayer and tending to the wounded and sick.\n\nIf you would demonstrate your immense piety by donating a sum of gold to the temple, it would surely become known all over the land that you have done so, and you would of course also be mentioned in the daily prayers.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAreligious.31;They shall have my support!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTBreligious.31;I'm sure they'll manage anyway.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAMEreligious.32;An Invitation;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCreligious.32;My [Root.GetLordLady], we have received an invitation to visit the famous Temple of Melitele!\n\nIt could make for a most interesting journey. Temple of Melitele is one of the best known places set up in [This.Religion.GetRandomGodNameCap]'s name. Although subject to the County of Ellander the temple has more then once disregarded the policies of their secular liege all in their devout service to [This.Religion.GetRandomGodNameCap]. In addition to their piety it is also a great center of charity and learning.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAreligious.32;A wonderful opportunity!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTBreligious.32;Tell them I can't come.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAMEreligious.33;Temple of Melitele;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCreligious.33;So this is the famous Temple of Melitele! The temple is built against a mountain cliff towering majestically over many buildings some even stretching deep within the mountain. The temple itself and buildings are surrounded by gardens, but the most breathtaking place is a small grotto near the temple, it is roofed by crystals making natural greenhouse of sorts. You can see many priestesses moving about and a also spot a monk or two. You can sense the atmosphere of learning, piety and power.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAreligious.33;I must study the magnificent temple!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBreligious.33;May I see the library?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTCreligious.33;I have come here to pray.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCreligious.100;The Solarist school of thought holds that the Sun is the highest deity of Solar faith and Emperor is only it's servant. The clergy of your realm have fully embraced this school, leading to a surge in religious fervor.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAreligious.100;This is the right path.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCreligious.101;The Imperialist school of thought holds that the Emperor is the highest deity of Solar faith and reincarnation of Sun itself. Many nobles have embraced this school to earn the favor of Emperor.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAreligious.101;This is the right path.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;;;;;;
