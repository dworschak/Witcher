EVTDESCmisc.1;Tonight the night sky is clear, and you can see every single star shining in the sky like jewels on a fine, black dress. What wonder can be found in heaven’s creation! What magic! You have a rare moment of peace in yourself as you admire the night sky.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAmisc.1;Amazing.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCmisc.2;A butterfly landed on my arm. It looks so harmless, just fluttering its wings, unaware of my existence.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAmisc.2;I’ll wait until it flies away.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBmisc.2;Shake it off.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTCmisc.2;Smash and kill it!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCmisc.3;I can’t fall asleep quickly at night. I just can’t. There’s so many distracting noises - night guards walking around, animals outside making noises, the things I think inside my head... When will it stop?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAmisc.3;Gargh! I’ll try closing my eyes again.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBmisc.3;I think I’ve just figured out a way to make an earplug...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCmisc.4;Lately, in the morning, you’ve snuck out of your residence with a few trusted bodyguards, to walk the beaches and smell the fresh ocean breeze at dawn. There is something amazing when you heard the waves crashing on the sand, the sound of pure, raw, natural energy.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAmisc.4;But now I better get back home...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCmisc.5;Hammers, anvils, wood, footsteps, bleating, beating, shouting, ships, waves, stones, coins, grabbing, crashing, smashing, ropes boxes, barrels... there’s so many sounds and sights around the docks. "How do we do it?" one of the workmen say, when you ask them. "We just got used to it.";;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAmisc.5;The things you fellows go through every day...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBmisc.5;There’s a reason why inferiors work here, unlike me.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCmisc.6;The distant memory of kissing your first love for the first time has been haunting you these past few days. Unfortunately, your love was a mere commoner, a peasant’s child who used to live near your castle when you were younger. Eventually, as you recall sadly, you two had to part, when…;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAmisc.6;Your guardian discovered the affair.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBmisc.6;You had to separate, out of a sense of duty.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTCmisc.6;Your love died in an unfortunate accident.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTTOOLTIPAmisc.6;What could you do? Your guardian was right - there was, and is, no way a noble and a peasant could marry.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTTOOLTIPBmisc.6;It was painful telling your lover the news.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTTOOLTIPCmisc.6;If only you weren’t distracted by other business that day, you could have saved your lover!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCmisc.7;It was sad knowing you would never see your first love again. Though young, this event taught you a very valuable lesson, that…;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAmisc.7;Everyone has a place in society, including myself.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBmisc.7;Life is terrible, and no one is ever happy.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTCmisc.7;No matter what, I will see my love again in heaven.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTDmisc.7;True love is stupid idea.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCmisc.8;You got lost while hunting in your territory. As you find your way back, you by chance come to a small but hazardous river. You suddenly remember how you were once here, as a young man, hunting with your friends. One of them nearly died tripping on a slippery rock. At the time you thought it hilarious, seeing your friend slip like that. ;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAmisc.8;Now I see we were foolish to ignore the dangers.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCmisc.9;"You! I know you! We were still youths when we last met!" exclaims the merchant you accidentally bumped into. It takes a few seconds for you to recognize one of your childhood friends. It isn’t long before you two go to the tavern to catch up. As you two reminiscence about your younger days...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTTOOLTIPmisc.9;The two of you engage in good conversation. It is always good to see an old friend!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAmisc.9;You ask him about that girl he once loved.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBmisc.9;You talk about when the two of you were apprentice merchants.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTCmisc.9;You discuss the hardships of life.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTDmisc.9;You share your adventures as traders traveling the world.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCmisc.10;"Haha, I’m glad that ended well, though," your friend says. You learn that while he is not too wealthy, he has engaged in some rather cunning and profitable schemes as a traveling merchant. For instance, there was one time he and one of his associates managed to purposely crash the market price of pyrite in one city as part of their business scheme.\nCertainly, he has learned a lot traveling around. After a while, you ask him, "Why don’t you work for my family’s business? I know you’re capable, and we can provide you the financial protection and assets you need.";;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAmisc.10;"I need to think about it, but it’s a hard offer to refuse!" he replies.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCmisc.11;"Haha, too bad it didn’t end as well as I hoped," your friend says. The two of you continue chatting for some time, but eventually you part ways, for tomorrow your friend will travel to a far-away city to engage in some venture. Before leaving, however, your friend offers you some useful advice on the constantly changing prices of various goods your family tends to trade in. "In the Far East, the price for several commodities are dropping really fast, and I think it will affect several key markets," he tells you, before explaining why. As you listen intently, he continues, "In order to profit from that, I suggest that you…";;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAmisc.11;I did not expect that! I must act fast to profit from this.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCmisc.20;While traveling on some official business, you and your men come across elven ruins, although old and worn, traces of it's past splendor still remain - the beautiful statues, the gardens of roses now gone wild.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAmisc.20;A glory long gone.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBmisc.20;Just a heap of stones.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTCmisc.20;What an impressive sight.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCmisc.100;I drank some water and choked on it. Thankfully a servant saved me, but my court witnessed the entire embarrassing situation.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAmisc.100;A frightening experience!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCmisc.101;After a stressful day, drinking some fresh, cool water is so relaxing.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAmisc.101;Aaaahhh...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCmisc.102;The wells used by your court for water have dried up. It is time to dig up new ones, and soon, or else everyone at the court will die of thirst!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAmisc.102;Send the men to find a new well.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCmisc.103;Yesterday I went to the local tavern and had too much beer. While drunk I ordered a large amount of pickled eggs to eat with my beer, as I usually do. However, this time, in my drunkenness I must have taken and paid for all the pickled eggs the tavern had. Now do I not only have to deal with my hangover, I have to figure out what to do with these eggs.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAmisc.103;Looks like we'll be eating pickled eggs for a while...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCmisc.104;I live near the sea, and thus my ears constantly suffer from the loud shouts of the traditional hues - cliff top lookouts who help fishermen. They constantly shout "hevva, hevva!" to alert the fishermen as to where the fish are. I love my fish, but all this shouting is driving me crazy!";;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAmisc.104;Gah! I can't do much. We need the fishermen if we want fish, after all.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCmisc.105;A tree of great magical powers has been discovered in one of the provinces I rule. Druids says that the tree appears to have a certain special appearance and properties. For as long as it stands, it will protect the surrounding region.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAmisc.105;A sign of good fortune.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCmisc.106;A small hill-fort was recently discovered near your residence. Old indeed, it appears to have been a fortification built by your ancestors to protect themselves from Elves and dwarves when they ruled the lands.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAmisc.106;What a dark yet heroic age it must have been!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCmisc.107;A lesser nobleman in my realm gave me an hourglass as a gift. It should help me keep track of time.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAmisc.107;Thank you!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCmisc.108;Oh no! I overslept and was late to this morning's meeting with my advisors!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAmisc.108;Why didn't the servants wake me on time?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCmisc.109;One of my newest personal servants is a diligent fellow, determined even. He always makes sure I do things on time - it pays to have a servant like him!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAmisc.109;Indeed.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCmisc.110;The sun is high above - it’s noontime, isn’t it? And it is rather hot outside. You’ve been out for a bit too long doing whatever business you were doing, and you’re starting to feel a little light-headed.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAmisc.110;Better retreat inside into the shade, maybe drink some water too.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBmisc.110;I have some business to finish, unfortunately!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCmisc.111;Oh dear, it seems like I've misplaced one of my rings. Goodness gracious, what am I to do?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAmisc.111;Oh well... hopefully we'll find it....;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBmisc.111;Why should I worry about it when there are more important things at stake?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCmisc.112;Thankfully, I've discovered where I misplaced my ring. It was under my bed.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAmisc.112;I thought I had lost it forever.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCmisc.113;One of my courtiers seems to be sad. Why I asked why, I learned that their favorite horse was very ill, and unlikely to survive. I remember this steed was a fine specimen, worthy of honor and praise, who brought its master much prestige and joy.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAmisc.113;Such is life, unfortunately!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBmisc.113;Truthfully, I never liked that horse.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCmisc.114;While traveling to a nearby town on official business you come across a corpse on the side of the road. Upon further inspection, it appears to be a beggar who died of who knows what.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAmisc.114;Ignore the corpse and move on.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBmisc.114;Inspect it - maybe the beggar has something of use?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
inspect_beggars_corpse;“What?” you say as everyone looks at you, bewildered. “Beggars might carry useful things! I read it in a story once!”;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCmisc.115;As one of your guards approaches the beggar, the old man suddenly jumps up. Everyone shouts in surprise, and your guard nearly cuts down the man by accident. It seems like the beggar was actually just in deep sleep.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAmisc.115;Haha, what a fool.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBmisc.115;Haha, have a coin, beggar, and [Root.Religion.GetRandomGodName] bless you.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTCmisc.115;Kill that bastard! He dares offend me!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCmisc.116;The beggar has nothing useful. That's to be expected. Behind you, someone says, “What sort of [Root.GetTitle] goes around searching beggars, anyways?”;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAmisc.116;I feel foolish.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCmisc.117;The beggar seems to have a precious amulet of some sort - your suspicions were correct! Yet you can’t help but wonder. Why did he keep it, when he could have sold it for money? Did he steal it, and was unable to sell it? Or was it something so precious to him he couldn’t bear to part with it? Or was he just plain stupid?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAmisc.117;It’s mine now, at any rate. I probably can sell it.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBmisc.117;I don’t feel comfortable looting this beggar’s corpse.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCmisc.118;What was that?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAmisc.118;Never mind. Must have been my imagination.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCmisc.119;Bwahahahahahahahahahaha! The suffering of others makes me feel so giddy inside. ;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAmisc.119;It's like music to my ears.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCmisc.120;Now and then, I like to sneak out at dusk and watch the sun as it sets in the sky.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAmisc.120;It's lovely, isn't it?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCmisc.121;Today’s sunset is particularly beautiful. Words can’t describe it.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAmisc.121;I’m loving it.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCmisc.122;I’ve learned that one of my courtiers enjoys watching sunsets, just like me. Yesterday we watched the sunset together, and found that despite our differences, we both shared many things as well.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAmisc.122;My sunset-watching buddy!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCmisc.123;I feel as if my life was just a part of some bard's pathetic tale, and I'm just a character in it.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAmisc.123;Who would care about my life, anyways?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCmisc.124;This itch is really bothersome. I can't stop scratching it.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAmisc.124;I look like a fool in front of my court!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCmisc.125;Something smells funny….\n\nNever mind, the smell went away.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAmisc.125;Must’ve been my mind playing tricks on me.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCmisc.126;In the middle of a conversation with a courtier, you pause, suddenly. You forgot what you were going to say next.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAmisc.126;I hate it when that happens.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCmisc.127;Some disgustingly horrific, vile thought just entered my mind. Try as I might, I can’t get rid of it!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAmisc.127;If I told my court, they’d think me a lunatic.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBmisc.127;Then again, this isn’t the weirdest thing I’ve thought of.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTCmisc.127;Then again, I've thought of weirder shit.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCmisc.128;There is a large clump of dirt under one of my fingernails.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAmisc.128;Who cares.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBmisc.128;Better remove it.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCmisc.129;The weather is unusually pleasant today.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAmisc.129;A good day!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCmisc.130;Eerie, loud noises were heard at night in some of the nearby villages not too long ago. They were sometimes accompanied by strange colors in the sky. Investigation by our officials and soldiers could not determine as to what was the cause.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAmisc.130;Frightening!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCmisc.131;A strange report from one of your messengers! It appears that every inhabitant of one of the villages in your realm has mysteriously vanished a year ago. Many have searched far and wide, but none were able to where any of these villagers went. Were they murdered? Wandered away? Kidnapped by bandits or otherworldly beings?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAmisc.131;Seems like supernatural forces at work. Heavens preserve us!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCmisc.132;While eating, you accidentally put way too much salt on your food, mistaking it for sugar or cheese or something of that sort.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAmisc.132;This tastes horrible! Too salty, too salty!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCmisc.133;While holding court, I notice one of my courtiers is picking their nose.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAmisc.133;Disgusting! I should look away.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBmisc.133;I should draw attention to and embarrass them.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTCmisc.133;Well, I like picking my nose too, so I don't see what's the issue.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCmisc.134;In your realm, stories have spread of a conman who sells “charms” to unsuspecting children. Some have said that these charms are actually real, others claim they are fake. Some say the fake ones are as effective if not more than real charms, and yet others believe the opposite. Regardless, the conman seems to have mysteriously left for other lands.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAmisc.134;I wonder whether he was a real conman, or a fake one?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCmisc.135;Three pretty wenches throw themselves at you.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAmisc.135;YES!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
three_wenches;Three beauties at once? The only thing better than this is...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBmisc.135;I'm not in the mood for this.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCmisc.136;Unfortunately, it seems three wenches were too much for you, and you exhausted yourself way too quickly. In other words, you were a bit too eager, and embarrassed yourself due to your lack of stamina.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAmisc.136;Now I’ll be a laughingstock.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBmisc.136;I have no regrets.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCmisc.137;You had a great tumble with those three wenches. Rumors are now spreading about your insatiable lust and great virility.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAmisc.137;I feel like a real, manly man.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCmisc.138;While visiting one of the local taverns, you spot a barmaid, unusually attractive for a peasant. You starting making a move on her, but unlike other wenches you’ve come across, she begs for you to leave her alone. She dare refuses you, so mighty and powerful! She should be serving your needs, no?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAmisc.138;I'll do with her as I wish!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
harassing_barmaid;You can't wait to satisfy your lust.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBmisc.138;It is wrong to force her like this. I shall leave her alone.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCmisc.139;As you rip her clothes off, and start having your way with her, you fail to notice a dark figure nearby. Before you or your guards can react, a man - who could be her husband, brother, father, friend, or someone else - jumps on you, screaming for you to leave her alone, and begins stabbing you. Though your guards quickly take care of him, it’s too late.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAmisc.139;Gugghhhh....;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
harassing_barmaid_bad_end;Before you pass out, you hear someone mutter, "That's what he gets for trying to mess with a girl like that.";;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCmisc.140;While out and about, visiting one of the local towns, I saw a most peculiar scene. A young man seemed to be gifting a friend of his a roasted bird, for food, but when his friend took the bird, it sprang to life! It was never dead in the first place. The friend looked terrified, while the young man only laughed at his successful prank.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAmisc.140;That was funny!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBmisc.140;I should ask him how he did that... I want to try such a prank!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCmisc.141;I farted so loudly everyone must have heard me.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAmisc.141;Um...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCmisc.142;I can’t believe it! One of my courtiers absolutely detests one of my favorite stories. Who could even think of criticizing it? Every time I read it I am absolutely spellbound. It has great character development, engaging dialogue, thought provoking themes, and deep symbolism.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAmisc.142;I admit it can be lewd here and there, but surprisingly this enhances it!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBmisc.142;I admit it can sometimes be a bit hard to read.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTCmisc.142;I admit I haven't actually read it, but it's perfect to hide a plum vodka bottle behind!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTDmisc.142;I admit you have to appreciate poetry to enjoy it.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTEmisc.142;I admit it's a bit generic, but still..,;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCmisc.143;If my life was simply a bard’s tale, what kind of story would it be, I wonder?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAmisc.143;Romance;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBmisc.143;Satire;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTCmisc.143;Epic;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTDmisc.143;Allegory;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCmisc.144;Lately there’s been a fad amongst the younger people, where they tilt their head in strange or awkward positions in order to emphasize things they say in the middle of a discussion. These “head tilts” are supposed to make them look imposing or mysterious. To my surprise, I’m pretty good at it myself and unlike the youths, I can pull it off well without looking like a fool.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAmisc.144;My neck is very flexible! Now fear me!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBmisc.144;That said, I don’t want to partake in this stupid fad.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCmisc.145;I accidentally bit my tongue.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAmisc.145;Ouch!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCmisc.146;Being a [Root.GetTitle] is dangerous as I have many enemies who want to kill me. Sometimes this makes me worry a lot. Today I even admitted to my beloved [Lover.GetName] that sometimes I fear [Lover.GetSheHe] is plotting my murder. Upon hearing this, [Lover.GetSheHe] responded, "Of course I want to be the one to kill you. If I kill you, I'll be the one closest to your deathbed.";;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAmisc.146;You're so sweet and romantic!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBmisc.146;I don't want that kind of twisted love.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTCmisc.146;Ha ha, you always cheer me up.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTDmisc.146;You really are trying to kill me!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCmisc.147;One of your courtiers is ridiculously lazy despite having the sort of talent men would envy. I keep trying to push this courtier to do something, to contribute to the world, to no avail. When I asked the reason for all this laziness, I got this reply: "If I don't have to do it, I won't. If I have to do it, I'll make it quick. Look, I'm not lazy. I'm just conserving my energy.";;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAmisc.147;Conserving energy to do what? Sleep all day?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBmisc.147;Heh. I like that.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCmisc.148;Your face is buried in your hands as you sit on your chair. You feel like you almost want to cry, or scream, or something. Life, it is so difficult! Your plans, always gone astray. Your hopes, always dashed. Your dreams, always destroyed. I'm in despair!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAmisc.148;My realm's troubles has left me in despair!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBmisc.148;The lack of male heirs has left me in despair!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTCmisc.148;Being unmarried has left me in despair!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTDmisc.148;My lack of prestige has left me in despair!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTEmisc.148;My lack of piety has left me in despair!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTFmisc.148;On second thought, I have no reason to despair!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCmisc.149;"Nice boat," my lover comments, as we are inspecting one of my family's ships leaving port on a business trip.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAmisc.149;Why, thank you, that's so kind of you.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBmisc.149;Are you... YOU'RE TRYING TO KILL ME!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
#;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
