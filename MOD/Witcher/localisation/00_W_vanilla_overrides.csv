EVTDESC100180;It's hard being a good [Root.Religion.GetName] these days, but my friend truly shocked me when I realized we did not share the same religion. My dear friend is a heretic!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTTOOLTIP100181;[Root.GetTitledFirstName] tries to convert [This.GetTitledFirstName] to a God-fearing [Root.Religion.GetName];;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESC100181;[From.GetTitledFirstName] is a devout [From.Religion.GetName], so when I told [From.GetHerHim] that I believed in [Root.Religion.GetRandomGodName] rather than [From.Religion.GetRandomGodName] I knew what [From.GetSheHe] was going to say. After a long, heated discussion about religion, considered disadvantages and advantages of our respective religions I decided to...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA100181;...keep my religion but lose my friend;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTTOOLTIP100185;[Root.GetTitledFirstName] cannot be friends with someone who does not respect [Root.GetHerHis] religion;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESC100184;It went exactly as I had feared - [From.GetTitledFirstName] couldn't accept me being a [Root.Religion.GetName] and condemned me and my religion.

Our disagreement about religion were never solved and [From.GetTitledFirstName] told me I was no longer [From.GetHerHis] friend...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
